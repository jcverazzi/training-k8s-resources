# ARK 

## Overview

Ark gives you tools to back up and restore your Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes. Ark lets you:
* Take backups of your cluster and restore in case of loss.
* Copy cluster resources to other clusters.
* Replicate your production environment for development and testing environments.

Ark consists of:
* A server that runs on your cluster
* A command-line client that runs locally

You can run Ark in clusters on a cloud provider or on-premises.
